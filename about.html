<b>Garamani campus was bla bla bla bla write whatever you want to! here i'm writing some random texts. With companies like Apple, Facebook and Twitter recording record numbers and dominating the online world, it's easy to forget that these companies are still quite young and had very humble beginnings. Since there are so many great interviews and discussions out there, we rounded up a number of interviews featuring those responsible for starting up some of the biggest tech companies out there. Some are quite long so you won't be sitting through all of these in one go, but all are well worth watching.</b>
